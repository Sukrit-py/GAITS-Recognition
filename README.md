## Introduction

Our project, "Gait Recognition System for Healthcare," leverages video analysis and recognition algorithms to analyze gait patterns, focusing on stability, balance, and mobility, particularly for individuals aged 65 and above. This system provides valuable insights for healthcare professionals to detect potential mobility issues, prevent falls, and offer personalized interventions. Key components include data collection, video acquisition using depth cameras, feature extraction, and recognition algorithms like CNNs and RNNs.

## Needs

- Current healthcare systems lack comprehensive tools for precise gait analysis and assessments of mobility, stability, and fall risk.
- Proactive measures for predicting falls, especially in elderly populations, are insufficient.
- Continuous posture monitoring is essential, especially in chronic conditions like low back pain, to gain insights into postural control and related challenges.
- Variability in gait patterns requires tailored gait recognition algorithms to ensure accurate and inclusive assessments.

## Problems

- Unavailability of a diverse dataset poses a challenge to algorithm development.
